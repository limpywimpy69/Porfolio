                <h3>2D Java Game </h3>
                <p>	
                    My first major project was a 2D game developed in Java, where I applied core Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles such as encapsulation, 
                    inheritance, and polymorphism. I was responsible for designing and implementing key gameplay mechanics, including player movement, enemy AI, collision detection, 
                    and basic game physics. In addition to programming, I created custom pixel art and frame-by-frame animations for characters, environments, and user interface elements
